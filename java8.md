# Computers

*A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.*

Input: Your keyboard and mouse, for example, are just input units—ways of getting information into your computer that it can process. If you use a microphone and voice recognition software, that's another form of input.
Memory/storage: Your computer probably stores all your documents and files on a hard drive: a huge magnetic memory. But smaller, computer-based devices like digital cameras and cellphones use other kinds of storage such as flash memory cards.
Processing: Your computer's processor (sometimes known as the central processing unit) is a microchip buried deep inside. It works amazingly hard and gets incredibly hot in the process. That's why your computer has a little fan blowing away—to stop its brain from overheating!
Output: Your computer probably has an LCD screen capable of displaying high-resolution (very detailed) graphics, and probably also stereo loudspeakers. You may have an inkjet printer on your desk too to make a more permanent form of output.

# Number systems Theory

Numerical systems are based on counting using an alphabet and operations. The decimal number system uses the alphabet {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, called digits, and the basic operations add, subtract, mulitply, and divide, symbolised as {+,-,*,/}.

The decimal number system has enough digits to count 9 items. To avoid creating as many digits as quantities we might encounter, the idea of relative or positional counting is used. The digit 5, for example can mean five, fifty, five-hundred, or five-millionth. Similarly for all the other digits - except zero (0). Zero is unique in that it serves as a place holder so that the other digits are correctly positioned. Thus the numbers 5, 50, 500, 0.000005 all contain the digit 5 to represent different quantities and the 0 digit merely allows us to correctly position the 5.

Digits are arbitrarily defined, so the digit 2 could mean forty-nine, 3 perhaps means seven (not the digit 7), and so on. While this may seem crazy, the fact is this flexibility is exactly what enables computer scientists to design language aware tools, like word-processors, spell checkers, and rudimentary language translators.
