*Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations. You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together. The flowcharts show the paths between each step*

*To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help)*

# function

*Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task & Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value & An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.*

*In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window*
