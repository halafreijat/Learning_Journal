# JavaScript 

## the ABC OF programming 

*It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).*

*If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.*

 # RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES

1.All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet, an underscore, or ( _ ), or a dollar sign ($).  The convention is to always use a letter of the alphabet.  The dollar sign and the underscore are discouraged.

20After the first initial letter, variable names may also contain letters and the digits 0 to 9.  No spaces or special characters are allowed. 

3.The name can be of any length, but don't get carried away.  Remember that you will have to type this name.

4.Uppercase characters are distinct from lowercase characters.  Using ALL uppercase letters are primarily used to identify constant variables.  Remember that variable names are case-sensitive.

5.You cannot use a java keyword (reserved word) for a variable name
