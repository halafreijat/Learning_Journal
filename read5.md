*Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps me convey the mood and evokes reactions There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:             X RGB values, hex codes, and color names*


*Color pickers can help you find the color you want It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast  X between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content)*

*CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to  indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,   with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA*


**thank you**
